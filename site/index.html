        <p><b>Implementation description : </b>As we are getting data continuosly from server, therefore I am checking data
            after every 5s and updating the table after sorting the data. We have to display the 30 seconds data in a sparkline,
            so Sparkline will appear after 30 seconds. I have used plain javascript.
